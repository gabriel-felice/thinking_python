# Memory Module Calculator
This is a simple project intended for learning.

# Objective

Study and Learning:

- Input dada validation
- Conditional logic and arithmetic
- Functions creation and reuse
- Good practices to keeping code clean
- Code organization for future reference

# How it works
- Receive an input in GB (0 < GB <= 64)
- Convert the value from GB to MB
- Calcule how many modules of 4, 8, 16 and 32 GB are necessary.
- Verify dual-channel possibilities
- Verify motherboard compatibilty


## Commit 2

- Refactored the code, removed a bunch of messy conditions.  
- Still wondering what I was thinking with 'memrounded'. :-p

## Commit 3

- Oops - renamed 'README.MD.TXT' to 'README.MD'.

## Commit 4

- Switched to 'append()' and 'enumerate()' - much cleaner now!  
- Said goodbye to 'n = 0' and all its siblings.  
- Also tried to fix some of the English.

## Commit 5

- Remove unnecessary line

### What's next?

- Accept any GB value (no more 64 GB cap)
- Add support for 64 GB modules
- Build a simple interface (no idea how yet - time to learn!)
