# Polynomial Solver
This is a simple project intended for learning.

# Objective

Study and Learning:

- Input dada validation
- Conditional logic and arithmetic
- Functions creation and reuse
- Good practices to keeping code clean
- Code organization for future reference
- Mathematics fundamentals

# How it works
- Receive polynomial inputs: degree and coefficients value
- Receive an initial aproximation
- Receive the number of iterations
- Return root aproximation


## Commit 1 

- First build with basic functionality with simple polynomials.

### What's next?

- Implement support for complex root and detection polynomial without real roots
- Detect when derivative tends to zero;
- Implement a convergence critery to avoid unnecessary iterations;
- Modularize the code with functions;
- Refactor and clean the code.
